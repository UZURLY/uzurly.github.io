Hi! I’m Uzurly, 16 years old, from Belgium.  
I’m passionate about cybersecurity, hacking labs, CTFs, and exploring Windows & Active Directory systems.

I enjoy writing detailed writeups to share what I learn from each challenge.

## HTB ProLabs
I’ve completed several Hack The Box ProLabs, including:  
Zephyr, Dante, P.O.O

These labs help me practice real-world penetration testing scenarios and improve my skills.

## Certifications & Goals
I’m currently preparing the CPTS certification and plan to take the CJCA from HTB.  
My long-term goal is to achieve OSEP and OSCP certifications.
